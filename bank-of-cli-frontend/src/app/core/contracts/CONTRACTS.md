# Bank of CLI: API Contracts

This is the agreement between the frontend and the future backend. The mock backend
(`core/interceptors/mock-backend.interceptor.ts`) follows it exactly, and the real backend
must return the same shapes. **If you need a field changed, change it here first, then in
`core/models/`, then in the mock.**

- Base URL: `/api` (set in `environments/environment.ts` as `apiBase`)
- All bodies are JSON. All dates are ISO 8601 strings in UTC.
- Money is a plain number in dollars with at most 2 decimal places (`1325.75`).
- Endpoints marked 🔒 need the header `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
  The `authTokenInterceptor` adds it automatically after login.

## Data models

TypeScript versions live in `core/models/`.

### User
```json
{
  "id": "u1",
  "name": "Demo User",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "createdAt": "2026-01-05T15:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Account
`id` is also the public account number people type into the Transfer form.
```json
{
  "id": "ACC-1001",
  "userId": "u1",
  "type": "checking",
  "balance": 1325.75,
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

### Transaction
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | |
| `accountId` | string | The account this record belongs to |
| `type` | `"deposit"` \| `"withdraw"` \| `"transfer-in"` \| `"transfer-out"` | |
| `amount` | number | **Always positive.** Use `type` to show + or - |
| `balanceAfter` | number | Balance right after this transaction |
| `date` | string | ISO 8601 |
| `description` | string (optional) | |
| `counterpartyAccountId` | string (optional) | Only on transfers: the other account |

```json
{
  "id": "t4",
  "accountId": "ACC-1001",
  "type": "transfer-out",
  "amount": 150,
  "balanceAfter": 1013.58,
  "date": "2026-09-09T12:00:00.000Z",
  "description": "Concert tickets",
  "counterpartyAccountId": "ACC-1002"
}
```
A transfer creates **two** records: `transfer-out` on the sender's account and `transfer-in`
on the receiver's account.

### Error (every failed request)
```json
{
  "status": 422,
  "code": "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS",
  "message": "Insufficient funds. Available balance is $25.00.",
  "field": "amount"
}
```
- `message` is written for users, so it can go straight into a toast.
- `field` (optional) names the form input at fault, so forms can highlight it.

| Code | HTTP status | When |
|---|---|---|
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 400 | Missing or invalid input (see rules below) |
| `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` | 401 | Wrong email or password at login |
| `UNAUTHORIZED` | 401 | Missing or bad token on a 🔒 endpoint |
| `FORBIDDEN` | 403 | Account belongs to someone else |
| `ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Account id does not exist |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Unknown endpoint |
| `EMAIL_TAKEN` | 409 | Register with an email already in use |
| `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` | 422 | Withdraw or transfer more than the balance |
| `NETWORK_ERROR` | 0 | Server unreachable (created by the frontend, never sent by the server) |
| `UNKNOWN` | 500 | Anything else |

---

## Validation rules

The server enforces these. Forms should check the same rules **before** submitting so the
user sees errors instantly.

| Field | Rule | Message |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | Not empty | Name is required. |
| `email` | Valid email format | Enter a valid email address. |
| `password` (register) | At least 6 characters | Password must be at least 6 characters. |
| `amount` | A number | Amount must be a number. |
| `amount` | Greater than 0 | Amount must be greater than zero. |
| `amount` | At most 2 decimal places | Amount can have at most 2 decimal places. |
| `amount` | At most 1,000,000 | Amount cannot exceed $1,000,000. |
| `amount` (withdraw, transfer) | Not more than the balance | Insufficient funds. Available balance is $X. |
| `toAccountId` | Not empty, not your own account, must exist | (see endpoint) |
| `description` | Optional, at most 100 characters | Description must be 100 characters or fewer. |
